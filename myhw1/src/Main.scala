   Exercise 1: PPascal's Triangle.
   As this course is PP, we are going to build PPascal's Triangle.
   This is similar to the Pascal's Triangle (google it!) except that
   it adds the upper left value once more.
   Write the program to calculate the number in PPascal's Triangle,
   for the given row and column.
